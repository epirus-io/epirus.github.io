It provides a rich interface for interpreting data on your ledger, with detailed views of:

The flexible user experience provides search, filtering and sorting capabilities, allowing users 
to easily find the data they require.

This is coupled with its integrated smart contract registry which provides unrivalled insights 
into the behaviour of your blockchain applications, and a RESTful API to facilitate ad-hoc 
reporting of your data.

It additionally supports both public and private permissioned blockchains such as the 
Ethereum networks, [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/besu) and [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) by J.P. Morgan.
