## Error: `Unable to create instance on Azure - your deployment failed`

Due to a timeout issue, provisioning of Epirus has failed on Azure on some occasions.

If you hit this issue, you will see the following error:

![Deployment failed](./img/issue-deployment-failed/deployment_failed.png)

The specific message is:

``` shell
epirus.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
```

To resolve the error, you will need to logon to the host that was created. To do this, click on the virtual machine name:

![Deployment hostname](./img/issue-deployment-failed/deployment_hostname.png)

Then copy the DNS name of the host:

![Host DNS name](./img/issue-deployment-failed/dns_name.png)

Logon to the host by running:

``` shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<private-key> epirus@<hostname>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com
```

Then run the following to start Epirus manually:

``` shell
sudo systemctl start epirus.service
```

Epirus should start, and if you head to the hostname in your browser, you should see the Epirus loading screen:

![Loading screen](./img/loading.png)

After a few minutes you should see Epirus has started successfully:

## Error: `Unable to create instance on Azure - the template deployment is not valid`
![Azure creation error](./img/azure_create_error.png)

``` shell
The template deployment 'blk-technologies.azure-blockchain-explorer-templa-20190701100047' is not valid according to the validation procedure. The tracking id is '494a6331-33c6-4c13-8871-359117dfa70b'. See inner errors for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-deploy for usage details.
```

Check that the instance name that you have used is globally unique. Using a common name such as `test` in the below example will fail:

![Epirus instance name](./img/epirus_instance_name.png)

If this does not resolve your issue, please [email us](mailto:support@web3labs.com) with details of the parameters you're trying to use.
